   It is dangerous for women to romanticize the typical alternatives to marriage. Most unmarried
    parents do not live together and most nonresident fathers pay little child support. Women are
    providing a much higher proportion of the financial support of children than previously. Thus,
    in the new low-marriage regime, compared to the old regime, women are still providing most
    of the labor inputs to children and are providing much more of the financial support for children.

   The Beauty of Love:
    The question is asked, "Is there anything more
    beautiful in life than a young couple clasping hands
    and pure hearts in the path of marriage? Can there be
    anything more beautiful than young love?"
    And the answer is given. "Yes, there is a more
    beautiful thing. It is the spectacle of an old man and an
    old woman finishing their journey together on that path.
    Their hands are gnarled, but still clasped; their faces are
    seamed, but still radiant; their hearts are physically
    bowed and tired, but still strong with love and devotion for
    one another. Yes, there is a more beautiful thing than
    young love. Old love."

   The Straw Theory applied to the Marriage Movement:
    What we have to keep in mind is that the marriage movement is a
    process, not an event. Each of us has to do the small part we are able to
    do. Collectively, these small steps will make a big difference.
    
    I am a great believer in what I call "the straw theory of life." You
    have obviously heard the phrase: "the straw that broke the camel's back." Question:
    what causes the back to break? Answer: the back is already loaded down with
    straw and that last straw is one too many. I believe each of us is
    obligated to throw our "straw" on this problem. If we don't, the pile
    will never build up and the "last straw" the one that "breaks the camel's back"
    will never be reached. I see this effort next Thursday to organize the Michigan Mediation
    Project as simply an opportunity to throw a straw.
    
    The good news is I can see more and more straws being thrown. It is
    a long, slow, tedious effort, but the pile is growing. What we have to do
    is not get discouraged, but keep throwing our straw at every opportunity.

   Eight-Cow Wife:
    Johnny Lingo lived in the South Pacific. The islanders all spoke highly
    of this man, but when it came time for him to find a wife the people shook
    their heads in disbelief. In order to obtain a wife you paid for her by giving
    her father cows. Four to six cows was considered a high price. But the woman
    Johnny Lingo chose was plain, skinny and walked with her shoulders hunched
    and her head down. She was very hesitant and shy. What surprised everyone
    was Johnny's offer -- he gave eight cows for her! Everyone chuckled about it,
    since they believed his father-in-law put one over on him.
    
    Several months after the wedding, a visitor from the U.S. came to
    the islands to trade and heard the story about Johnny Lingo and his
    eight-cow wife. Upon meeting Johnny and his wife the visitor was totally
    taken back, since this wasn't a shy, plain and hesitant woman but one who
    was beautiful, poised and confident. The visitor asked about the
    transformation, and Johnny Lingo's response was very simple. "I wanted an
    eight-cow woman, and when I paid that for her and treated her in that
    fashion, she began to believe that she was an eight-cow woman. She
    discovered she was worth more than any other woman in the islands. And
    what matters most is what a woman thinks about herself."

   Daddies do matter:
    Last night (1/20/99) 60 Minutes featured a show about elephants.
    
    Several decades ago there was a problem with overpopulation
    on an African game preserve - too many elephants. Limited by the technology
    available at the time, the solution arrived at was to move the babies to new preserves.
    Everyone watched, gravely concerned, but the babies thrived.
    
    However, unintended consequences emerged. At the new locations, a decade
    or so after the transfer, someone was killing off rhinoceros which are an endangered species.
    It turned out the killers were young male elephants. At first the game wardens
    couldn't believe it, this was uncharacteristic behavior never before seen in elephants.
    
    They deduced that the young males had grown up without fathers - without
    male role models. New technology had made it possible to transport into these
    locations some large mature bull elephants. There was concern that it would be too late, that
    the adolescent males had to have grown up with their elders, that
    bringing "daddies" in now would do no good. But they tried it anyway.
    
    It worked like a charm. The mature bulls arrived and set things
    straight. The young males immediately stopped their precocious, rampant sexuality,
    killing and violence.
    
    The conclusion drawn on 60 Minutes was that we had no idea that the social system of
    the elephants was so complex, interconnected, and so elegant.
    And so it goes. Daddies do matter, even in elephants.

    And, apparently it works both ways:
    Our experience with nearly 4,000 court-ordered clients suggests that when fathers are
    more involved in the lives of their children, they are unlikely to hurt any woman. While
    developing our intervention for domestic violence, we took a group of young men (mean age 22),
    all of whom had at least two children from previous relationships and who were court-ordered
    for abuse of their current partners. As is too often the case with young fathers, none of these
    guys had a relationship with his children. We gave them a brief course called Compassionate
    Parentingwhich raised their awareness of the emotional worlds of their children, particularly
    their need to have fathers who cared about them and looked out for them. Without direct
    intervention for domestic violence, these young men got more involved in the lives of their
    children and completely stopped abuse of their current partners. (The normal recidivism rate
    for unmarried men of this age group was over 60 percent, after domestic violence intervention.)
    Compassionate Parenting is now a crucial part of our domestic violence programs.

   Some Things We Keep
    I grew up in the forties and fifties with practical parents - a Mother who washed
    aluminum foil after she cooked in it, then reused it. A Father who was happier
    getting old shoes fixed than buying new ones. Their marriage was good,
    their dreams focused. I can see them now, Dad in trousers, tee shirt and a hat
    and Mom in a house dress, lawn mower in one hand, dishtowel in the other. It
    was the time for fixing things - a curtain rod, the kitchen radio, screen door, the
    oven door, the hem in a dress. Things we keep. It was a way of life, and sometimes
    it made me crazy. All that re-fixing, reheating, renewing, I wanted just once to be
    wasteful. Waste meant affluence. Throwing things away meant there'd always be
    more. But then my Mother died, and on that clear summer's night, in the warmth
    of the hospital room, I was struck with the pain of learning that sometimes there
    isn't any 'more'. Sometimes, what we care about most gets all used up and goes
    away.....never to return. So, while we have it, it's best we love it and care for it.....
    and fix it when it's broken.....and heal it when it's sick. This is true for old cars.....
    and children with bad report cards.....and dogs with bad hips.....and aging parents
    .....and grandparents...and marriage. We keep them because they are worth it,
    because we are worth it. Some things we keep.

    H was very helpful in the kitchen. He usually got home from work around 3
    PM, and he usually made dinner for the family. I don't get home until around
    5 PM. He did all the yard work, took care of all car maintenance, always
    called me if he was going to be late, instilled complete trust, did the
    lion's share of bill paying because I hate to write due to carpal tunnel
    syndrome, balanced the checkbook, fixed the toilet when it would break
    (regularly), painted the outside of the house.
    He usually remembered to put the toilet seat and lid down. He vacuumed
    occasionally. He spent lots of time with the kids. He bought advent
    calendars with chocolate behind each day for the kids every Christmas
    season. He laughed and joked a lot, and didn't like to be serious. He told
    me when I looked good. He learned to enjoy horses because our girls and I
    loved to ride.
    
    He was willing to try new dishes I prepared. He loved my lasagna. He went to
    church with the family every Sunday, even though he had trouble staying
    awake during preaching. Although he doesn't like classical music, he went to
    almost every concert our daughters played in when they were in youth
    symphony (4 years for one and 6 years for the other).
    
    He held my hand through 3 labors and deliveries, and whispered in my ear to
    encourage me. He lovingly dressed an open wound for me after surgery for a
    breast abscess after the birth of our 3rd. Four years later, he stood beside
    my bed as I was being wheeled to surgery to remove a breast due to cancer,
    and tears filled his eyes as they did mine. That was in 1989.
    
    He walked the floor for hours at night with a sleepless, cranky child. He
    spooned cereal and baby food into little mouths, and endured spit-up and
    baby poop on his clothing. He helped me take care of my mother as she was
    dying of cancer.
    
    Is this what you mean, JJ? It was difficult to get started, but look what I
    accomplished! I also have a huge lump in my throat and tears in my eyes
    right now. He was a fantastic husband! My sister told me he "adored" me, and
    I guess that's correct for a lot of the 26 years we have been married.

   Leo Tolstoy got married in 1862, and it was the best thing that
    ever happened to him. He wrote, "Domestic happiness has swallowed me
    completely." His wife had 13 children, and she helped him copy out and edit
    all his manuscripts. She copied by hand the huge manuscript for War and Peace
    (1868) four times. During the first years of his marriage, free love was
    becoming fashionable among the Russian upper classes, and everyone started to
    think of marriage as old fashioned and silly. Tolstoy was disgusted. In 1872,
    he heard about a woman who had thrown herself in front of a train after the
    end of an affair, and it gave him an idea for a novel about a woman whose life
    is destroyed by adultery. That novel was Anna Karenina (1875). He wrote it as
    a defense of marriage as the most important foundation of society. When it was
    published, most critics said it was inferior to War and Peace, but it is now
    considered one of the greatest novels ever written.

   Frank Pittman is an ardent defender of the concept of marriage. His
    insights are unique and valuable. These thoughts got our attention.
"Marriage is not supposed to make you happy. It is supposed to make you
    married, and once you are safely and totally married then you have a
    structure of security and support from which you are free to make yourself
    happy, rather than wasting your adulthood looking for a structure."
    We think his comments are right on target. We've seen many people bail
    out on marriage because it failed to make them happy. Pittman thinks they
    have their priorities reversed. You work on building the marriage first
    and happiness comes after that. It's only when we are fully committed to
    one another in the marriage relationship that we can have hope of
    happiness. That will take place despite obstacles that must be overcome.
    Pittman believes "It must withstand change, aging, loss of youth, loss of
    beauty, loss of youthful hopes, and an expectable lifetime full of
    disappointment."

   One last point about how talking to your man is different from talking to your girlfriend.
    By and large, a man wants the bottom line. Cut the amount of prelude by approximately
    ninety percent, and youโll get it just about right. Instead of saying, โHoney, my mom
    went in and the doctor diagnosed varicose veins. Sheโs going to have to get them
    stripped, which will make it very difficult for her to walk for a couple of weeks. As you
    know, she lives all alone now, and the only person who can help her is Mrs. Jenkins,
    who just visits twice a week, on Thursdays and Fridays. Momโs going to need more
    help than that.โ Trust me, youโve probably lost him by that point. Instead, try this:
โHoney, my mom is having surgery next week and needs some time to recover.
    Do you mind if she stays with us for a few days?โ If he wants more information,
    heโll ask for it. Keep it short.

    Some close friends filed for divorce. When we explained the situation to our
    boys, they were confused and declared, โWe donโt understand. They were
    so happy whenever we were with them.โ I asked what they would
    do if they were married and their wife got upset and mad and even
    treated them mean. Without hesitation, my youngest, declared, โI would hold
    her.โ How could a four year old know the security a woman feels when a
    pair of strong arms gently wrap around her!? When I am stressed or worried,
    my heart immediately softens if my husband simply holds me. I asked Philip
    WHY he would hold her. He explained that thatโs what Dad always says in the
    ceremony. Philip had witnessed several of the vow renewal services that conclude
    our marriage conference weekends. As in a wedding ceremony, Sam leads
    couples to repeat their vows, โTo have and to hold from this day forwardโ.
    Unlike many married couples, Philip took these vows literally.

   For all the talk of love, it often seems that what Winterson is really talking about is

   One member of a couple says (as if this is an excuse for leaving), "I love
    him (or her), but I am no longer in love." Love is an action word, I want
    to say. When was the last time you "loved" him (or her) by your actions?
    Love is not just a feeling. Love is a verb. We have control over what we
    do, not what we feel. Similarly, I only have control over what I do โ not
    what my partner does. If I do not like what is happening or how I feel,
    what can I do differently? As I behave differently, many times I get a
    different response. How many times do I take for granted those thoughtful
    actions or tasks a partner may complete? Do I say thank you? Do I show my
    appreciation? Do I care enough about my partner to do something they like,
    just as a love gift โ not as a should? Do I do these things without
    expecting something in return? If I expect something in return and do not
    get it, I will feel resentment, which is poison in a relationship. A gift
    is only a gift if it has no expectations attached.

   Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not promises of

    just being โin love,โ which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left
    over when being in love has burned awayโฆ.Your mother and I had it, we had
    roots that grew towards each other underground, and when all the pretty
    blossoms had fallen from the branches, we found that we were one tree and

   DEAR ANN LANDERS: Please advise your readers before they send a wedding gift
    to check and make sure the couple is still married. I wish I had.
"Mary" and "Jerry" were high-school sweethearts. They went together five
    years before they married. Everyone thought they were the perfect couple.
    The wedding was one of the most beautiful this town has ever seen -
    bridesmaids, ushers, a flower-laden canopy, a string quartet, a harp - the
    whole nine yards.
    I spent a lot more on my dress and the gift than I had a right to, but I was
    so sure the relationship was rock-solid and that this would be the social
    event of the year, I went all out.
    I sent the gift 10 days after the wedding.
    Guess what? Five weeks after the extravaganza, the couple split.
    They were divorced the following month. No wedding gifts were returned.
    What do you think of this, Ann Landers?

    DEAR SKUNKED: Back in 1993, the Bureau of the Census predicted that four out

   OSLO - With a free Saturday on his hands and a new downtown apartment to
    fill, the affable 27-year-old man known simply as Haakon put on jeans,
    sweater and sneakers, bundled himself against the Nordic winter in a gray
    duffel coat and went to check out some sounds in a record store and shop at
    discount houses.
    Hours later, he returned home with his purchases and was greeted by his
    lover, Mette-Marit Tjessem Hoiby, 27, and her 3-year-old son, Marius.
    So far, this is nothing out of the ordinary for Oslo, where even the most
    urbane people dress informally, more than half of children are born out of
    wedlock and cohabiting is common.
    But just how common this particular pair are permitted to be has become a
    test for the famously tolerant Norwegians.
    Haakon is the country's hereditary prince, a man who one day will quite
    likely have to trade his earphones for a king's crown.

   An explanation for today's ostentatious weddings:
    
    May I suggest another reason for ostentatious weddings? Many of today's
    couples live together before they are married. Thus the thrills of
    yesteryear's weddings are gone. No longer is there the fun of decorating the
    love nest. Why get excited about the honeymoon destination when they've
    traveled all over already? Who cares about their first dance, first toast,
    first anything -- they've been there, done that. So to create a sense of
    excitement, today's couples have to beef up the wedding day with fancy cakes,
    elaborate favors and over-the-top gowns to get guests fired up for a wedding
    that has nothing to do with beginning a life together, but is more like a
    salute to themselves with the added bonus of gifts.

    youโre eighty youโre so in love that you wobble when you walk. To do
    this, you have to have a plan and you have to be deliberate.

   WEDDING VOWS:
    
    
    Diane,I have done a number of weddings over the past 25 years and have included vows not only for the couple, but for the parents of the couple. In my premarital counseling I usually meet and talk with parents and stress their important role instrengthening their children's marriage. In my remarks during the wedding Isay that this is marriage is not just a union of two individuals, but of twofamilies and stress the importance of the merging of the two family groupstogether to help provide part of the "glue" for this new marriage. Then,after the couple recites their vows, I turn to the bride's parents and say,"Will you, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, take Bob to be your son-in-law, will you lovehim, care for him, treat him as your own son, and do all you can tostrengthen and encourage his marriage to your daughter? (They answer "Ido.") "Will you, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, take Jennie to be yourdaughter-in-law, will you love her, care for her, treat her as your owndaughter, and do all you can to strengthen and encourage her marriage toyour son?"(They answer "I do.")Bill Beahm, Ph.D.National Center for Fatheringwww.fathers.com

    married one year, two years, five years, eight years, and so on were asked
    to leave. The last couple standing were married 56 years and the wife was
    given the bridal bouquet by the bride.

   The DJ at my son's wedding did something similar. As the longest
    married couple was left standing (my aunt and uncle who have been married 62
    years) - he asked them what advice they might give as to the secret of what
    makes a good, lasting marriage. My uncle did a wonderful job and included the
    ability to admit when one is wrong and say "I'm sorry" even when you think you
    were only 10% wrong; learning to laugh at ourselves and not take life too
    seriously. It was a wonderful tribute to them and an affirmation of marriage for us all.
    And, at the rehearsal dinner we took few moments of silence and then as a part
    of a prayer of blessing we called out the names of those that could not be in
    attendance (either deceased or for some other reason not able to attend). It
    reminded us of the importance those persons and the influence they have had
    and will continue to have on us and on the newlyweds as they begin their lives
    together.

   When my daughter was married a couple of years ago, at the end of the evening
    the MC asked everyone to form a circle around the bride and groom. He then
    gave a speech about how โmarriage will have its ups and downs and all the people
    surrounding you right now are here to support you through whatever happens.โ
    Then he asked everyone to hold hands and walk slowly around them in a circle
    as the band played, โYouโll Never Walk Alone.โ (There wasnโt a dry eye.)

   My stepdaughter, who will be 18 in January, is getting married next August. Since
    she has experienced the divorce of her parents and is marrying young, I wanted
    to do more than just throw a bridal shower. I decided to have a marriage party
    instead at which we will have several happily married couples--some of which
    married in their teens--share their stories and give advice. Instead of towels
    and spatulas, I will be asking the couples to give gifts of marriage books,
    videos, and classes to help this young couple have a successful marriage.

   When my husband and I got married 47 years ago, we felt that the tossing of the bouquet and the garter were mindless rituals that people did only because of tradition. Somewhere in an etiquette book I read that it was perfectly proper to select someone to receive the bouquet as a gift (and today I wouldn't worry about whether the etiquette book said so or not). I then thought of my groom's elderly, sweet grandmother who was too frail to travel 500 miles to our wedding. At the reception, I gave my bouquet to my new mother-in-law, to take home to her mother. Later I learned that Grandma B, as we called her, had dried that bouquet and treasured it till her death several years later. More recently, my daughters did something similar. It makes much more sense.- Madeline Johnston
